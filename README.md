# Qalam Arabic Maps

A powerful and elegant Arabic map parsing application inspired by Qalam.ai.

Advanced Arabic POI Intelligence API
"Our high-performance API transforms messy, natural language Arabic queries into structured, high-intent geospatial data in milliseconds. Powered by a specialized Qwen 2.5 architecture, the engine performs deep semantic analysis—extracting entity categories, geographic constraints, and intent nuances that traditional search engines miss. Engineered for enterprise-grade reliability, the service offers a stateless, low-latency infrastructure capable of handling high-volume requests without compromising precision. By integrating our API, developers can bypass the complexity of Arabic NLP and immediately offer their users a search experience that is as fast as it is intelligent, making it the definitive backbone for the next generation of MENA-focused location discovery platforms."
